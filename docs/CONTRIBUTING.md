## How Can I Contribute?

We appreciate all forms of contributions! Here’s how you can get involved:

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please follow these steps:

1. **Search existing issues**: Ensure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2. **Create a new issue**: If no existing issue covers the bug, create a new issue and include:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Expected and actual behavior.
   - Any relevant screenshots or error logs.
3. **Label your issue**: Add appropriate labels such as `bug`, `urgent`, or `enhancement`.

### Suggesting Features

If you have a feature idea, we’d love to hear about it! To suggest a feature:

1. **Check existing suggestions**: Make sure your idea hasn’t already been suggested.
2. **Create a new issue**: If it’s a new suggestion, create a detailed issue describing the feature and why it would be beneficial to the project.
3. **Discuss your idea**: Be prepared to discuss the feature with the community and maintainers to ensure it's aligned with the project goals.

### Submitting Pull Requests

To submit a pull request (PR):

1. **Fork the repository**: Click on the “Fork” button at the top of the repository.
2. **Create a branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   - Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `add-new-feature`, `fix-issue-123`).
3. **Write tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by appropriate unit or integration tests.
4. **Follow coding standards**: Make sure your code adheres to the project’s coding standards.
5. **Submit your PR**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch and include a detailed description of the changes and the issue it addresses (if applicable).
6. **Wait for review**: Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers, and you may be asked to make changes before it is merged.
